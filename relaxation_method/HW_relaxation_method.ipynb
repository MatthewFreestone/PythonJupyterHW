    "In mathematics, a function $f(x)$ is said to have a \"fixed-point\" solution if there exists a value $x_{*}$ such that $f(x_{*}) = x_{*}$. That is, $f$ maps $x_{*}$ to itself. As a simple example, given $f(x) = x^{2}$, check that $f$ has a fixed-points at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a less trivial example, let's see if the function $f(x) = x^{2} - 1$ has any fixed points. That is, we want to find all solutions to $f(x) = x$:\n",

    "### Caveats to the relaxation method \n",
    "For all its simplicity, the relaxation method is not a completely robust solution for finding fixed points, in which case this method can only potentially find one, for a given initial guess. It will fail if your function does not have fixed points. It is also very much possible for a function to have multiple fixed points. Additionally, this iterative process can \"blow up\" and lead you to ever-growing numbers if you use a \"bad\" starting guess. It is possible for the relaxation method to get stuck in a loop. If you try to find the fixed points for $x^2 - 1$ using an initial guess of $x_{o} = 0.5$, you will find that you eventually repeatedly guess 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, .... Be aware of these pitfalls when you are testing your code - they are a fundamental issue of the relaxation method, and not a symptom of bad code. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need not worry about accounting for these issues in your code. You will never be given pathological functions/guesses that would cause these issues, in this homework.\n",

    "See that $M = 0$ for high temperatures, meaning that the material is non-magnetic when it is at a temperature greater than 1 (no actual units, since we set all those constants to be $1$). However, once the material is cooled to $T \\leq 1$, the material suddenly magnetizes, and its magnetization strengthens as you cool it further.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sudden magnetization at $T = 1$ is a *phase transition*. This is very similar to water freezing: water's atoms molecules will rapidly begin to form a crystal once they are cooled to 0-celsius or below. Similarly, we see that a ferromagnetic material's electrons will suddenly be able to coordinate and produce a net magnetic field throughout the material, once they are cooled to $T=1$ and below.\n",

    "This is a no-joke physics problem that we were able to solve thanks to the relaxation method! If you look up the constants, $\\mu$ and $J$, for a specific material, you can repeat this computation to produce its actual magnetic phase diagram. This rules!"
